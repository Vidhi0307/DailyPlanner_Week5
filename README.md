## Description

This project is to implement a day planner using html,css,javascript,jQuery and third party APIs.The functionality included displaying the current day and date ,Time-blocks color coded based on time.(past ,present and future.).
I am glad that I was able to use the skills learnt and implement a functional code.





## Installation

-A public link has been created for the website which requires any web browser.


## Usage

The code renders to a webpage with a day planner showing time blocks starting from 9AM to 9PM.

-Next to every time block hour is a input area for entering an event.
-Once you add an event there is a Save button,clicking on the save button saves the event to the local storage.
-Refreshing the page will still display the added events because they will be extracted the local storage.

-Note: The existing code was modified to add on the functionality.

Code changes done:
HTML file has been changed:for adding time blocks and buttons.
-adding jquery and Moment API libraries.

JS file has been changed:
-Added functions for rendering the color coded time blocks.
-implementing saving functionality.
-implementing extracting from local storage functionality.
